A simple K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to recognize handwritten digit input, trained on the MNIST dataset kindly borrowed from [THE MNIST DATABASE of handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

### Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Upload a handwritten digit (black number on white background) to the `local_test_image/` folder. Set `image_path` to the respective file path
3. Run the program `python main.py`

The output will display handwritten digit prediction and its nearest three neighbors (if uncommented in `display_results()`)
